# Data Visualization of Bird Strikes

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI project that analyzes the "Bird Strikes Data". The project includes the Power BI report file and the dataset used in the analysis.

## Files
- `Birds_strike_analysis.pbix` - The main Power BI report file.
- `Bird_Strikes_data.xlsx` - Contains bird strike data with columns: Record ID, Aircraft Type, Airport Name, Altitude bin, Aircraft Make/Model, Wildlife Number struck, Wildlife Number Struck Actual, Effect Impact to flight, FlightDate, Effect Indicated Damage, Aircraft Number of engines, Aircraft Airline/Operator, Origin State, When Phase of flight, Conditions Precipitation, Remains of wildlife collected, Remains of wildlife sent to Smithsonian, Remarks, Wildlife Size, Conditions Sky, Wildlife Species, Pilot warned of birds or wildlife, Cost Total $, Feet above ground, Number of people injured, Is Aircraft Large.

## Usage
1. Download the `Birds_strike_analysis.pbix` file.
2. Open it in Power BI Desktop.
3. Ensure that the dataset file (`Bird_Strikes_data.xlsx`) is placed in the folder relative to the .pbix file location.

- **Airports with most incidents of bird strikes â€“ Top 50**: List and analysis of the top 50 airports with the most bird strikes.
- **Yearly Cost Incurred due to Bird Strikes**: Annual cost analysis of bird strikes.
- **When do most bird strikes occur?**: Analysis of the time of day and phase of flight when bird strikes occur.
- **Altitude of aeroplanes at the time of strike**: Distribution of altitudes at which bird strikes occur.
- **Phase of flight at the time of the strike**: Analysis of the phase of flight during bird strikes.
- **Average Altitude of the aeroplanes in different phases at the time of strike**: Analysis of average altitudes during different phases of flight.
- **Effect of Bird Strikes & Impact on Flight**: Analysis of the impact and damage caused by bird strikes.
- **Effect of Strike at Different Altitude**: Analysis of how the effect of strikes varies by altitude.
- **Were Pilots Informed? & Prior Warning and Effect of Strike Relation**: Analysis of the relationship between prior warnings and the effects of bird strikes.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have Power BI Desktop installed to view and interact with the `.pbix` file.
- The dataset file (`Bird_Strikes_data.xlsx`) must be in the same directory as the `.pbix` file for the data to load correctly.
